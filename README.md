# Tweet2Speech

I put together a simple Python script that makes use of the BeautifulSoup and gTTS libraries to parse a twitter feed for content and convert that content to speech (as an mp3 file.)

# Setup

You will need to have BeautifulSoup as well as gTTS installed... i.e.:

pip install bs4

pip install gtts

# Example Audio

I used a public figure's feed (Dalai Lama) as an example... and the audio from the feed is provided.
